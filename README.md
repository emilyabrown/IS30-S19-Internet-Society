Department of Information Studies, UCLA

Summer 2019, Tuesdays and Thursdays 2pm - 3:50 pm GSE&IS 121

INSTRUCTOR: Dustin O’Hara

EMAIL: dustin.ohara@gmail.com

OFFICE HOURS: Tuesdays or Thursdays before class (by appointment)


## COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
This course is an introduction to the social and technical developments that have led to today's Internet and related information and communication technologies (ICTs), and the consequences of these technologies for society and culture. The course will cover the history and design of the Internet, internet activism and governance, the contradictory interests of the networked political economy, and the ethical implications of future internet research and emerging technologies. The course will be one part seminar and one part speculative creative laboratory. Students will critically and creatively engage with a combination of technical and societal issues. 

The course satisfies the Society and Culture-Social Analysis GE requirement for the College of Letters & Science, and is open to all majors. This course also counts towards the Digital Humanities minor. Upon satisfactory completion of this course, students should be able to:

basic web development and design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no prior experience necessary).

Summarize the main points of historical development of Internet related technologies.

Summarize major societal issues associated with today’s Internet, including socioeconomic impact, privacy and surveillance, security, intellectual property, information resources and infrastructures.

Discuss and evaluate current perspectives or points of view on these issues;Stay informed about Internet-related issues through a critical and reflective survey of newscoverage and other general-interest media sources.

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING  
Students will be evaluated on the basis of their participation and performance in class and on other required assignments; the percentage of the final course grade for each activity is indicated in parentheses: Class participation (40%) comprised of contributions to the discussions in the classroom as well as posts your student weblog. Your participation grade includes weekly discussion posts that are short reflections on the course readings. These posts are due the night before our Thursday classes. Your participation grade hinges on thoughtful engagement with the course material. Three creative projects (60%) responding to a prompt , each assignment will include a written component that will engage with course readings. You are welcome to incorporate peer-reviewed and reputable, fact-checked journalistic articles to strengthen your argument. Below are short descriptions of the three main projects, a more detailed document for each assignment will be shared in the coming weeks.

### 0) Weekly Weblog (40%) 

[List of the student blogs](https://github.com/DustinOHara/IS30-S19-Internet-Society/blob/master/studentblogs.md)

To prepare for class discussions you will write a 500 word personal reflection about the readings. You should demonstrate that you understand the central arguments, highlight specific quotes from the texts, interpret their significance and relationship to your own life experiences. Publish your personal reflection before our Thursday class, unless instructed otherwise. Student weblogs and project sites will be published using Github, unless otherwise approved. 

Once you have created a Github account, here are a few pages that will help introduce you to Github and walk you through the process of creating a new repository and webpage.

### 1) Hyper-text Self Portrait (25%) Due Week 3 
Using HTML, specifically hyperlinks, text, images, and any other html elements, such a video or audio, to create a hyper-text self-portrait. You are encouraged to interpret the notion of self-portraiture in a broad open-ended way. The assignment will include a short written statement (500 words) reflecting about your self-portrait and the reading thus far. The statement will count as your personal reflection for week 2.

### Choose either assignment 2 or 3.   

### 2) Internet Archive Excavation & Analysis (35%) 1500-2000 words/presentation Due Week 6
Working on your own or in a group of two or three, select a website or set of websites and conduct a detailed analysis of the site’s design and how it changed over time. Describe the societal and technical circumstances that informed the changes in the site’s design, architecture, and use. Create a website that visually and illustrates your findings and analysis, including a bibliography and links to appropriate references. Using your website or slides, you (and your group) will present your findings and analysis to the class.  

### 3) Proposal for a Speculative Future (35%) 2000-2500 words/presentation, Due Week 6
Working in a small group (2-3 people), you will create a rigorously researched design proposal. Identify one topic of interest we’ve talked about in class thus far, it could be big data, privacy, self-driving cars, fake news. Once you have chosen a topic area, you will work with your group to create a speculative design proposal. The design proposal will center around an illustrated concept design/demo and written paper that describes the proposal in relative to the topic area. The written paper will describe the practices, agents and technologies of the topic area, detail contemporary affordances and limitations. Cite specific examples and course readings to create an argument to support your design concept. Be sure to identify how these speculative future developments might be ethically problematic or advantageous.

You will present your final project in class during week 6.

## READINGS AND COURSE RESOURCES
Students are expected to complete all assigned materials (listed below, under Weekly Topics and Required Materials) before class, and be prepared to summarize or comment on the assigned materials in class if called upon. All course materials are available via the course website, hosted at the UCLA Common Collaboration and Learning Environment (CCLE) website:  ccle.ucla.edu/

The website and other class materials are password-protected and intended for the exclusive use of students participating in IS 30. Students may not forward or circulate any course materials outside of class without the instructor's express permission.

## CLASS POLICIES

1. This course focuses on discussion: this is a read-think-talk class. With respect to personal conduct during class, each member of the class is expected to use his or her own judgment to determine how best to create, maintain, and preserve a respectful, studious, rigorous class environment conducive to this task. I trust each student to behave appropriately and professionally while we are together, but I must reserve my right to exact disciplinary measures as required to protect the learning environment. Please be courteous: silence your electronics, come on time and stay the whole class, limit your trips out of the room during lecture, and don’t distract other people with any non-academic doings.

2. Sometimes, I may ask you to forgo the use of electronic devices; other times, I may ask you to do something that specifically involves them.

3. We’re going to communicate face-to-face, via email, and through the CCLE course site. This can get confusing very quickly. Please check your email at least once before each class. You’ll need to access the CCLE site at least three times per week to get your posts done, although I hope you’ll use it more frequently.

4. All work for this course, with the exception of in-class activities will be published to your class blog. 
Be sure to use a standard citation style such as MLA, APA, or Chicago. Don’t guess how to format a citation correctly: look it up (https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/).

5. Back up all your work in case of technical difficulties. Disk errors, hungry dogs, and computer meltdowns threaten us every single day. You should prepare contingency plans for these common and inevitable mishaps in advance. We use a lot of technology to deliver this course, so we should expect technical difficulties.

6. You must complete all reading assignments, including preparation of discussion posts or reading summaries. Every week, we will read and discuss several works of varying length. Keep up on your reading and class blogs if you plan to pass this course.

7. Active and respectful participation is required. This presupposes your timely attendance. We will often open each session by going around the room for each person to give his or her considered response to the readings; further discussion will operate on a volunteer basis. I reserve the right to call on anyone at any time. You can avoid being singled out by participating vociferously and frequently.

### STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

Students with documented disabilities who wish to discuss academic accommodations should contact the Center for Accessible Education (www.cae.ucla.edu) and must notify the instructor at the start of the quarter so that appropriate accommodations can be arranged and coordinated with the CAE well in advance of course assignments and due dates.
