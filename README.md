## COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING  
Students will be evaluated on the basis of their participation and performance in class and on other required assignments; the percentage of the final course grade for each activity is indicated in parentheses: Class participation (40%) comprised of contributions to the discussions in the classroom as well as posts your student weblog. Your participation grade includes weekly discussion posts that are short reflections on the course readings. These posts are due the night before our Thursday classes. Your participation grade hinges on thoughtful engagement with the course material. Three creative projects (60%) responding to a prompt , each assignment will include a written component that will engage with course readings. You are welcome to incorporate peer-reviewed and reputable, fact-checked journalistic articles to strengthen your argument. Below are short descriptions of the three main projects, a more detailed document for each assignment will be shared in the coming weeks.

### 0) Weekly Weblog (40%) 
To prepare for class discussions you will write a 500 word personal reflection about the readings. You should demonstrate that you understand the central arguments, highlight specific quotes from the texts, interpret their significance and relationship to your own life experiences. Publish your personal reflection before our Thursday class, unless instructed otherwise.

### 1) Hyper-text Self Portrait (15%) Due: Friday of Week 2 
Using HTML, specifically hyperlinks, text, images, and any other html elements, such a video or audio, to create a hyper-text self-portrait. You are encouraged to interpret the notion of self-portraiture in a broad open-ended way. The assignment will include a short written statement (500 words) reflecting about your self-portrait and the reading thus far. The statement will count as your personal reflection for week 2. 
2) Internet Archive Excavation & Analysis (20%) 1500-2000 words, Due Thursday Week 3
Working on your own or in a group of two or three, select a website or set of websites and conduct a detailed analysis of their design over time. How did the site’s design, information architecture and interface features evolve over time? Describe the societal and technical circumstances that informed the changes in their design.

### 3) Proposal for a Speculative Future (25%) 2000-3000 words/presentation, Due Week 6
Working in a small group (2-3 people), you will create a rigorously researched design proposal. Identify one topic of interest we’ve talked about in class thus far, it could be big data, privacy, self-driving cars, fake news. Once you have chosen a topic area, you will work with your group to create a speculative design proposal. The design proposal will center around an illustrated concept design/demo and written paper that describes the proposal in relative to the topic area. The written paper will describe the practices, agents and technologies of the topic area, detail contemporary affordances and limitations. Cite specific examples and course readings to create an argument to support your design concept. Be sure to identify how these speculative future developments might be ethically problematic or advantageous.
